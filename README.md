## Self Assessment ##

I had mixed feelings before and during the first weeks of enrolling in the Data Analytics bootcamp at UC Berkeley. I do not have a previous professional or academic background in computer science or programming languages. Had I known what the course entailed, I might not have enrolled in this course. I wish there was an option to speak with a career counselor before taking this course and maybe I would have selected another certificate course at Berkeley. 

I did not drop out of the bootcamp because I thought that things will get easier and there some topics such as SQL, Tableau, APIs that I thought might be useful in my current job as a Business Analyst. 

The pace of the course and the assignments was a big challenge. Even though we had two weeks to submit an assignment, catching up with the study material, the number of deliverables for each module along with a fulltime job and family commitments was difficult to manage. 

What helped me the most and without which I would not have been able to complete this course was the 24/7 availability of Learning Assistants. I am also very appreciative of the support and encouragement from the instructors, TAs and our student success manager. The tutoring services are great! I took a few tutoring sessions for some of my assignments, and they were extremely valuable. 

Yes, I did manage to complete the assignments. But when it comes to actual learning experience from the course, I am disappointed to say, ‘not much’. 

In the last six months, I got a framework of the various programming languages, running SQL queries and got introduced to tools required to run some of the programming languages. I don’t feel I have acquired any technical skills to put on my resume and be confident for a technical interview. I don’t’ have any expertise yet. I still have A LOT to learn. 


## Summary of Final Project ##

Our team consisted of four, from various backgrounds, coming together to predict flight cancellations due to specific combinations of weather events. We also looked at other features such as airport location, airline, and possibly departure time.

We got the flight and weather dataset from Kaggle The secondary dataset for this project comes from The Global Airport Database and includes latitude and longitude data for more than nine thousand airports.

Once downloaded, the data was cleaned and processed using Python and Pandas in Jupyter Notebook and was uploaded to a PostgreSQL database. From there, it could be extracted using standard PostgreSQL SELECT and JOIN syntax and either saved to a CSV file or loaded directly into a single, combined Pandas dataframe.

We used machine learning models such as logistic regression and random forest for analysis. We ran several trials. The first trial of logistic regression with under sampling yielded an accuracy score of approximately 71%. We also tried over sampling and got a similar accuracy score of 71%. 

We switched to a random forest model to improve our prediction result. It showed an improvement in the accuracy score from 72% to 87%, and eventually to 99%!

## Team Assessment ##
While working on the project, we followed the rubric and took different roles for each segment. We communicated regularly on slack and connected on zoom as and when needed. The team was very sincere, and it was a great experience working with all of them.
